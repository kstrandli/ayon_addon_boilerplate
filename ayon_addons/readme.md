Create a folder for the ayon-specific addon folder structure.
The name of this addon-folder must match the name of the addon as defined in the "ayon_build_addons.py" and the class variable "name" on the BaseServerAddon class defined in /ayon_addons/[addon_name]/server/__init__.py

You can build multiple ayon-addons from a single repo/project this way, if you so choose.
Example:
./ayon_addons/scenemanager/...
./ayon_addons/corestudiotoolkit/...
./ayon_addons/studio_maya_toolkit/...
