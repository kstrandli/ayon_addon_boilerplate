To use developer-mode for this addon, point to this client folder in the Developer Bundle.
Ayon expects this folder to only contain a single directory, which is the main client-facing python package for the tool/addon.
This python package will be accessible to other addons.

You can develop your tool/addons main python package directly in this folder, if it's a Ayon-specific tool.
Alternatively, if you wish to develop the python package separately from Ayon, you can simply create a symlink to main python package in here, or use Git submodule (speculating here) if the main python package is developed as a separate repo.

This is only necessary for sourcing the addon locally for development purposes in Ayon Dev-Mode.
